// ??? This is an example of an optimization that can be useful under the right
// conditions: if a goroutine making writes to a channel has knowledge of how
// many writes it will make, it can be useful to create a buffered channel whose
// capacity is the number of writes to be made, and then make those writes
// as quickly as possible. There are, of course, caveats, and weâ€™ll cover them
// in the next chapter.
